# Monthly Food Price Inflation Estimates by Country

## Overview

This project analyzes **monthly food price inflation** across countries over the last two years (2021â€“2023). Food price inflation is a critical economic indicator that affects poverty, food security, and overall economic stability. By understanding trends in food price inflation, policymakers, researchers, and organizations can make informed decisions to address global food security challenges.

The project involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering monthly food price inflation data from reliable sources like the World Bank, FAO, and national statistical offices.
2. **Data Pipeline**: Building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to clean, process, and store the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
4. **Visualization**: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Summarizing key findings and suggesting actionable recommendations.
